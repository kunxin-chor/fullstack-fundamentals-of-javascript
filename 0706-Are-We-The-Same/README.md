Write a program to ask the user for two strings, and then compare if they are the same. 

The program should print **true** _if they are equal and **false** _otherwise.__

The program must be **case insensitive** _- that is, 'aPPLe' and 'Apple' will be considered as **equal**._

** Test Cases **
```
> ABCDEFG
> abcdefg
true
```

```
> apple
> banana
false
```


```
> Round and round
> Round and round
true
```
