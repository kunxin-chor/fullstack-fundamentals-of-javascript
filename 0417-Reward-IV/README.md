 Suppose a user took English, French, Physics and Chemistry exams.

- English and French are language subjects
- Physics and Chemistry are science subjects
- A user will get a new iPhone if he passes **at least ONE subject from EACH group**.

Write a program that asks the user for his grade his scores in each subject and displays either "Yay! New iPhone!" or "No new iPhone" based on the results.
