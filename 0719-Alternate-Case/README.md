Write a program that asks the user for a **string**, and then return characters with even index in **alternate case**:

** Example **

``` test case 1 ```
> apple
ApPlE
```

``` test case 2 ```
> he didn't heed the warning
He dIdN'T HeEd tHe wArNiNg
```

``` test case 3 ```
> HELLOWORLD
hElLoWoRlD
```

** 
hint - if you are having trouble with strings, remember that strings are immutable, meaning you should assign any strings with methods applied, to a new variable;
**
