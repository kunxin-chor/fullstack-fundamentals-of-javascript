Write a program that keeps asking the user to enter an integer until they enter -5. 

Tweak the program by replacing _**???**_ with your own code. 

** Test Cases **
```
> 1
> -1
> -5
Yes the number is -5!
```

```
> -5
Yes the number is -5!
```

```
> 1
> 2
> 3
> 4
> 5
> -5
Yes the number is -5!
```
