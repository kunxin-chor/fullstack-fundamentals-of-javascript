Write a program that asks the user to enter the PSI level (a floating-point number).


If it is equal or above 100, print **"unhealthy"**

If it is equal or above 50 but below 100, print **"moderate"**

Otherwise, if the PSI is less than 50, print **"healthy"**

Note:
```
# Example Input
PSI: 120


# Correct Output
Unhealthy
```
