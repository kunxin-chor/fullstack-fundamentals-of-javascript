Write a function named **correctLogin** that checks if the user has entered the correct username and password. 


The function should then return the **role of the user** if the username and password matches.

Otherwise, the function should return **false**.

**User 1:**

 user1: "jake"
 
 password1: "jake123"

 role: "admin"

 **User 2:**

 user2: "mary"

 password2: "mary456"

 role: "customer"
