Suppose a user took the English, Math and Science exams. The passing score is 50.

- He will get a Nintendo Switch if he passes his English, Maths and Science exams
- He will get a Book Voucher if he passes his English and Maths exams.
- He will get nothing for all other scenarios. 

Write a program that asks the user for his grade for English, Maths and Science, and display out "Switch", "Voucher" or "Nothing" depending on the criteria mentioned above.

Note:

- The argument for the prompt function should be: "What was your score for <**NAME OF SUBJECT**>?"
- Scores can have **decimals**
