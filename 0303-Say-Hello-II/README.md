Modify the function named sayHello where it asks the user for one input and will print out "Hello, <input>" with <input> being replaced by whatever value of the variable the user has entered.


**Hint:** 

- You can add one string to the back of another string by using the + symbol. 

```
# Example
print("Hello " + "World") will display "Hello World"
```
