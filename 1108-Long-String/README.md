Write a function **runOver** that takes in an **array of string** as the first argument and a function named **overSix** as the second argument.

The **runOver** function should return an array of the strings that have a length of 7 or more. 

The **overSix** function should return **true** if a string argument passed to it has a length of seven or more.

# Test Outputs
```
let a = runOver(['apples', 'strawberries', 'mangosteen'], overSix);
console.log(a)
```
Output should be:
```
['strawberries', 'mangosteen']
```
