 The area of a circle is calculated using the formula:

**area of circle = pi * radius of the circle * radius of the circle**

Assign the variable **pi** the value of 3.14

Suppose the radius of the circle is 23

Store the area of this circle in the variable **areaOfCircle**

Finally, print out the variable **areaOfCircle**.
