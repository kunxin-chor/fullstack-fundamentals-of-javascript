Write a function named **fizzbuzz**. //note all small letters

The function **fizzbuzz** returns **true** if an argument passed to it is both divisible by 3 and 5.

Then write another function named **testFizzbuzz**. It takes in an array as first argument and a function as its 2nd argument.

The **testFizzbuzz** function should return an array of numbers. No number in the array should be smaller than 11 or larger than 55. The array should only contain numbers divisible by 3 and 5.

Make sure **testFizzbuzz** uses the argument in its code.
