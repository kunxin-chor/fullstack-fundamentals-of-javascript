An muffin costs _X_ dollars and _Y_ cents.The user wants to buy Z muffins.

Write a program that asks the user to enter the value for these three variables:

- **x**
- **y**
- **z**

Calculate how much it will cost to buy z muffins.Display the total in **dollars and cents**. 

**_For example:_** if x=1 and y=90, then this means the muffin each cost $1.90

If x=3 and y=0 then this means each muffin costs $3.00.


For the case if each muffin costs $1.90 (which means x is 1, and y is 90), if we buy 6, then the total cost will be $11.40. It means it will cost 11 dollars and 40 cents.

If  we buy 10 muffins, then the output be 19 dollars and 0 **cents.**

**Test Cases**
```
> 1
> 90
> 6
11.40
```
```
> 1
> 90
> 10
19.00
```
```
> 2
> 50
> 30
75.00
```
