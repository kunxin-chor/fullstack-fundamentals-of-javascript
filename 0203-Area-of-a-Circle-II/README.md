Write a program to which will allow the user to input a floating point number. Assign that number to a variable named **radius**.

Create a variable named **area** and assign it the calculation of the area using the given **radius** and console.log the answer. Round up to two decimal point using the `toFixed` function:

```
let x = 3.1417;
console.log(x.toFixed(2)) // => "3.14"
```

Note:

**_Assume pi to be 3.14_**
